## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: Amelia 

* When was the company incorporated?
This company was founded in 1988.

* Who are the founders of the company?
The founders of the company are Chetan Dube and Michael Bordash. 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The main idea behind the company Amelia AI was to create an intelligence platform that interacts like a human with humans. The platform does not simply mimic human behavior or thought processes, but instead comprehends the underlying meanings of what is being communicated. Amelia connects the ideas between comprehensive goal to be achieved (Businesswire, 2024) This happens through LLM. For instance for new employee onboarding, Amelia learns the employee training manual enabling the software to communicate or provide recommendations or solutions to the human employee. As one can imaging this would reduce the amount of human interaction for human resources for employee onboarding.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

According to CB insights, only two out of three investors have been revealed. These include BuildGroup Management and Monroe Capital.
 
These are both unattributed VC (Venture Capital).

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Amelia seems to be very similar to Amazon's Alexa. However, Amelia is more geared towards providing a tailored customer service enabling customer agents to focus on more complex issues. In the case of the employee experience, Amelia uses AI to automate the onboarding experience.
 
Similarly, this is for any other type of business agent. In fact, my initial search focused on medical research which led me to Amelia for Healthcare. Customer experiences also include financial institutions, healthcare, insurance, telecommunications, and travel. Both agent and customer learn.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Intended customers may include any business type that wishes to launch AI a conversational AI platform for customer and/or employee engagement (Amelia, 2024).    

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

This company claims that their product incorporates a new process designer where it is easier to set up, includes icons making easier to configure and deploy (Amelia's New Conversational AI Process Designer, 2024). 
 
The visual tools enable the user to easily set up new processes. The software includes a process explorer allowing for users who are not AI experts to be quickly able to use the tool. The intuitive icons make building new processes easier to grasp. 
 
Amelia also allows users to create virtual assistants that "start on intent". The users can input commonly used phrases that launches the process that is correlated. Everyday users do not necessarily need to learn code to add widgets, images, etc. (Amelia’s New Conversational AI Process Designer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6aTLlKodYk)



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


The platform uses Natural Language Processing and Generative AI models (Gartner, https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/enterprise-conversational-ai-platforms/vendor/amelia/product/amelia). Amelia is able to listen what the user is saying, and generates a substantial response for the user. The advantage may be that for example, ChatGPT, which is a LLM as opposed to Natural Processing, gives some input, but is not conversational.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

 
If I were to advise the institution where I work, I would recommend Amelia conversational software as a part of the technology tolls implemented in employee onboarding. I foresee so many changes where this software can enhance employee onboaring.
 
Even in its simplest format, this tools would be so helpful. Currently, as an onboarding specialist for medical research professionals, there are many opportunities here to streamflow the onboarding process.
 
There are many research systems that employees encounter on a daily bases and sometimes most, if not all, systems integrate with one another. However, there are many instances of errors within the workflow between the systems.
 
For instance, consent forms for IRB studies have specific information for each of the systems to communicate effectively between them.
 
If one system operates where a specific piece of information is needed as compared to another system that may not necessarily need that information, this presents a conflict. Perhaps the Amelia could be trained to understand the specific needs for all entries for all systems and how they integrate together, and perhaps also make suggestions for onboarding these sets of learners.
